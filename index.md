### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 3 specifically, is one of my favorite labs since it was one 
    of the first labs I have done. I liked how it introduced how the labs
    will be in the future. Finally, I liked how part 3 was a hello world
    program, one of the most known beginner programs.

* Lab 3

    As for Lab 3, I liked how we were able to make our type of sandwich.
    We would use string variables to put in the protein, bread, and
    condiment. Then, we would use cout and cin to type in the needed
    information.


* Lab 7

    At last, Lab 7 was my favorite one because I liked how we had to
    find a date difference between two different dates. I also liked
    how we finally had to be able to define our function. Finally, I
    enjoyed how we had to implement math, like adding and subtracting
    into our functions.
